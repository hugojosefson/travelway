# travelway -> angular

Example implementation of a project structure suggested in the presentation [AngularJS, Practices for Large-scale
Development of Web Apps](http://slides.com/hugojosefson/angularjs-practices-for-large-scale-development-of-web-apps),
using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build.

This project structure uses a directory structure, which:

  * doesn't keep files in directories according to their file types (html, css, scripts...)
  * does keep a directory structure according to feature (login, landing-page, details...)

## Commands

### Recommended

```
npm start           Build and run the built app.
npm test            Run unit and e2e tests.

npm run dist        Build the app into the dist/ directory.

npm run clean-all   Clean out downloaded dependencies and build files.
                    Get a fresh start.
```

### More / Internal

```
npm run deps        Download dependencies. This is run automatically by all build commands.

npm run clean-deps  Clean out downloaded dependencies.
npm run clean-build Clean out built files.
```

## Directory structure

### Source code and configuration

```
/                               Project root. Global settings and dependency declarations.
/server/                        Server source code.
/gulp/                          Gulp build for this project.

/client/                             Client source code.
/client/index.html                   Where the client starts.
/client/modules/                     One directory under here for each AngularJS module.
/client/modules/demo-app/            The main app module.
/client/modules/demo-app/routes      Routes for the main app module.
                                     Directory structure here maps directly to the URL structure.
/client/modules/demo-app/components  Any other code in the main app module, not part of a specific route.
                                     One directory per component. No nesting directories.
```

### Build artifacts and other .gitignore'd stuff

```
/dist/                      Build artifact. This can be deployed on a server.
/dist/server.js             Server.
/dist/package.json          Dependency declaration for the server.
/dist/client/               Client webapp.

/node_modules/              npm packages for the gulp build.
/client/bower-components/   Libraries downloaded by Bower.
```
